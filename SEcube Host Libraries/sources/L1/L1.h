/** This class defines the attributes and the methods of a L1 object. L1 is built upon L0, therefore it uses a higher
 *  level of abstraction. L0 is focused on very basic actions (such as low level USB communication with the SEcube),
 *  L1 is focused on more "generic" actions, such as the encryption of data or the login to the SEcube using a specific
 *  PIN code. L0 should be used in the initial stage of any SEcube-related software, for instance to list all the available
 *  SEcube devices. Then, after a specific SEcube device has been selected, L1 comes into play allowing to login to the
 *  SEcube and to perform more complex operations (i.e. encrypt data). If a higher level of abstraction is needed (i.e.
 *  to perform even more complex operations, such as working on an encrypted file) then the libraries belonging to the L2
 *  level can be used (although it should be noted that a corresponding L2 object does not exist, since these libraries
 *  offer specific APIs to the developers).  */
