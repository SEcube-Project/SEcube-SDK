 *  generate the digest is HMAC-SHA256 because this algorithm requires the usage of a shared secret (a key) and a nonce (to avoid
 *  replay), hence the attributes of this class. If you simply want to compute the digest with SHA-256, then the nonce and
 *  the key are not used at all, therefore the only attribute you care about is the digest. */
